# small-business-network
Designed and implemented a three-branch small business network in Cisco Packet Tracer connecting Kilkenny (Head Office), Waterford, and Wexford over a WAN. Configured routers with static routing and serial DCE/DTE links, created subnetted LANs with DHCP servers for automatic IP assignment, and set up printers, switches, and PCs for full LAN/WAN communication.
